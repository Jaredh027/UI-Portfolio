This repo is dedicated to displaying some of the user interfaces I have developed.

# Miller Column
I was tasked with making this dialog below more dynamic and traversable without overloading 

the dialog with too much information.

After some thought, I was inspired by Apple's Finder which uses Miller columns. 

The Miller column carries a lot of benefits in traversing hierarchical data.
- Displays an appropriate amount of data
- Easily traversable
- Minimizes clicks
- Contains a view of multiple levels
- Space efficient
