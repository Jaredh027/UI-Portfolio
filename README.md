# UI-Portfolio
This repo is dedicated to displaying some of the user interfaces I have developed.

## Miller Column
I was tasked with making this dialog below more dynamic and traversable without overloading 

the dialog with too much information.

After some thought, I was inspired by Apple's Finder which uses Miller columns. 

The Miller column carries a lot of benefits in traversing hierarchical data.
- Displays an appropriate amount of data
- Easily traversable
- Minimizes clicks
- Contains a view of multiple levels
- Space efficient

## Comparison Interface
For this task, I was asked to create a more intuitive and understandable way to help a user add comparison logic.

Below is the initial interface.

Adding another comparison is very overwhelming for a new user of the application. So I decided to split this screen up into separate dialogs

and visually and functionally split up the different logic conditions.
